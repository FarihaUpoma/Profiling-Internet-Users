Please put the input data in a folder named '/users' before running codes.

There are 3 separate files for 3 time windows- 
1. finalAll10.py
2. finalAll5.py
3. finalAll227.py
4. They will populate the following folders respectively, which keeps the 1st and 2nd week’s doctets/duration values for each user-
1. usersOutput-Window10
2. usersOutput-Window227
3. usersOutput-Window5m


They will also create the following excel files- 
1. finalTable10.xlxs
2. finalTable227.xlxs
3. finalTable5m.xlxs


These files hold the final P Values. 


Finally, there’s another python file named analysis.py. By running this the number of matches and the average number of matches for all 3 windows can be found.
